# Mount & Blade II Bannerlord - Extension Mod


## Version and compatibility

This mod only works with game version **BETA e1.4.2**.

This mod is not save game compatible.

It is not recommended to use any other mods beside the ones mentioned below.

## Origin and usage

This is my first mod ever - but not my first program. I like Bannerlord very much, and while playing the early access I have downloaded and tried a lot of mods. At some point I decided to try and write my personalized mod-collection to enhance my game play experience. Thus this mod is a collection of a lot of small features.

How you can use this mod:
* Play the game campaign with this Extension as a standalone (only) mod to enhance your game play, just like I do.
* Play together with some other mods while disabling those Extension features you don't like or need. I can not guarantee compatibility with other mods though and I can not support this type of usage!
 * As a mod programmer to understand how to write mods for Bannerlord.

## Issues, errors and logging

**Logging**

The mod uses the game's own logging functions to write information and errors into log files. Upon a mod or game error the log files will most likely contain some useful information about the error.

* Default log file location: `c:\\ProgramData\\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\\logs`
* Default information log file name: `rgl_log_XXXXX.txt`
* Default error log file name: `rgl_log_errors_XXXXX.txt`

**Crash**

If the game crashes then select **yes** when the game asks if to create a report of the crash. If you suspect that a mod has caused the crash, you don't haveto send the report to Talewordls, but send it to the mod creator.

* Default crash file location: `c:\\ProgramData\\Mount and Blade II Bannerlord\\crashes\\DATE_TIME`
* Default crash file name: `dump.dmp`

**Known issues**

  * Use the shield featuer is currently not working
